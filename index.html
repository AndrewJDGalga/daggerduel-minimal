                    <li>You may place all or some of your 4 Potential Action tokens face up onto any unoccupied hexes on the board. This includes Barrier hexes. Barrier hexes cannot be surrounded by pieces, and so pieces on them are completely safe from Normal Capture: <img src="assets/safeHex.svg" alt="Example of a Barrier hex on the board."></li>
                    <li>You may return 1 of your 4 Potential Action tokens to your Token Supply to replace 1 of your Opponent's tokens that <strong>doesn't</strong> match thier current Footing with 1 of your other Potential Action tokens.</li>
